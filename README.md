# Label Detector Readme
## Description
This Node.js project, built using Express.js, provides an API service for image label detection. It integrates with Google Cloud's Label Detection API through the **GoogleLabelDetector** class. The service allows clients to send images for analysis, returning labels that describe the content of the image along with their confidence scores
## Getting started
### Prerequisites
List all dependencies and their version needed by the project as :
- Node V21.1+
- Npm V10.2+
- Typescript V5.3+
## API Endpoints
### Analyze Image
- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/analyse`
- **Method**: POST
- **Description**: This endpoint accepts an image for analysis and returns labels describing the image. The client can specify the maximum number of results to return and the minimum confidence level for the labels.
- **Request Body**:
  - `image`: (String) The image data or a URL to the image.
  - `maxResults`: (Number, optional) Maximum number of labels to return. Defaults to 7.
  - `minConfidenceLevel`: (Number, optional) Minimum confidence level for the labels. Defaults to 90.
- **Response**: A JSON object containing an array of labels and their respective confidence scores.
## Deployment
### On dev environment
1. Rename `.env.example` file to `.env`.
2. Complete the following variables in the `.env` file:
   - `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH`: The path to the JSON file containing your Google credentials.
   - `PORT`: The port on which the application will run (default is 4000).
 3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm i
    ```
 5. Run tests to ensure everything is configured correctly:
    ```
    npm run test
    ```
 7. Launch the application in development mode:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
### On integration environment
1. Build the application:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   This step creates a `dist` folder.
3. Place a `.env` file with production configurations inside the `dist` folder.
4. Launch the application:
   ```
   node dist/index.js
   ```
